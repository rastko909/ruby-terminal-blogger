1,7,3 facts you may not know about dogs,Rastko Beciric,06/03/2019,"Your dog is as smart as a 2-year-old toddler.

Dogs and cats both slurp water the same way.
This may be hard to believe since dogs are such messy drinkers, but just like cats, our canine friends bend the tip of their tongue and raise liquid in a column up to their mouths.
 
Your dog does have a sense of time — and misses you when you’re gone.
If you think your dog knows when it’s time for dinner or a walk, you’re right! Dogs pick up on our routines and habits, and they also sense how much time has passed. One study showed how dogs responded differently to their owners being gone for different lengths of time."
